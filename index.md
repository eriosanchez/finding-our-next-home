# Operation Find Us A Home!
This project is log of the research Ricky and Sami are doing to find a safe and happy home for themselves and their future family. Their research takes into account environmental, professional, and legislative landscape for two queer women of color working as an academic and a doctor. 
This site is also a bit of practice for Ricky who is learning and practicing coding! Ideally this log will also show the evolution of Ricky's coding journey and skills.
Each week Sam chooses a place that seems appealing, and Ricky does a bit of research about the place according to the parameters required.

# Request No. 1 - "Prairie"
This request from Sami likely is driven at least partly by her mother's deep affection for Little House On the Prairie. If we do end up in the prairie, I hope we'll find much more luck than the Ingalls family.

Generally, the prairie in the United States includes part or all of: Ohio, Illinois, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico. The eastern-most prairie is made up mostly 

## Initial Impressions

##### Immediate pros for the prairie:
- the Ingalls lived in Minnesota!
- Sami and Ricky have always liked the idea of having a farm and Ricky would thrive in a subsitence landscape
- Ricky has been really interested in Minneapolis as a place for ethnic American theatre as of late, so being close to Twin Cities could be great
- Colorado is a great place to practice queer health

##### Immediate cons for the prairie:
- the prairie is almost entirely red states which doesn't necessarily mean the states are our of the question, but safety will of course be an important consideration.

### Political Landscape

One of Ricky's biggest concerns when looking at any place to live or settle is legislation. With the impending overturning or Roe v. Wade, and the relative inability to effect change in a place where Ricky and Sam do not currently live, it seems important to look towards the likelihood of legislative change and/or the ability to realistically fight for protections. While Sami and Ricky are queer and don't anticipate needing abortions for their own survival, restrictive abortion access can be a harbinger for restrictions of all kinds on the bodies and lives of minoritized and oppressed peoples. 

Beccause of the above, [the New York Times' interactive map](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/us/abortion-laws-roe-v-wade.html) showing the legal status of abortion without Roe will be instrumental.

To give us a smaller starting point then, the choices for what Ricky might consider "workable or ideal" is Illinois, Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Montana, Colorado, and New Mexico. Still a sizeable list.

On the list of states with strong legal protections are Minnesota, Illinois, Colorado, and New Mexico.

On the list of states which would require good grassroots organizing are Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, and Montana?

##### Questions for Sami at this point:
- Are there any states that jump right out immediately?
- How do you feel about potentially dealing with tornadoes?
- Are there family medicine programs in any of these states that seem particularly interesting?
